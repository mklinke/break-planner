Historic pet project with the assumption to run in a local (corporate) network without a server.

Today, a cloud-hosted web project would be the way to go.

Original readme below:
========================================================

A peer-to-peer planner for your next lunch/coffee break.

The application is based on the following technologies:
 - Java Swing for the user interface
 - JmDNS for peer-to-peer networking
 - JodaTime for date and time calculation
 
Testing is done with JUnit and Mockito.

The project can be built with Maven.
